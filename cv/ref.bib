  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning network to predict future frames in a point cloud sequence. As main novelty, an initial layer learns topological information of point
clouds as geometric features, to form representative spatiotemporal neighborhoods. This module is followed by multiple Graph-RNN cells. Each cell learns points dynamics (i.e.,
RNN states) by processing each point jointly with the spatiotemporal neighbouring points. We tested the network performance with a MINST dataset of moving digits, a synthetic
human bodies motions and JPEG dynamic bodies datasets. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline ones that neglect geometry features information}

  abstract = {A new form of digital images, light field images contain considerably more information than conventional 2D digital images. However, light field images require significantly more storage, transmission and processing resources than conventional 2D images, calling for efficient compression schemes. In this work, light field images are interpreted as multi-view sequences that are compressed using MV-HEVC. A novel scan order based on blocks of sub-aperture images and a two dimensional prediction scheme are proposed for improved random access performance, as well as to provide a scalable representation of the light field data. Our proposed compression scheme achieves PSNR gains as high as 7.8 dB over reference coding schemes based on JPEG.}

  abstract = {This paper aims at bringing some light and understanding to the field of deep learning for dynamic point cloud processing. Specifically, we focus on the hierarchical features learning aspect, with the ultimate goal of understanding which features are learned at the different stages of the process and what their meaning is. Last, we bring clarity on how hierarchical components of the network affect the learned features and their importance for a successful learning model. This study is conducted for point cloud prediction tasks, useful for predicting coding applications.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning network to
                predict future frames in a point cloud sequence. As main novelty, an initial layer learns topological information of point
                clouds as geometric features, to form representative spatiotemporal neighborhoods. This module is followed by multiple Graph-RNN cells. Each cell learns points dynamics (i.e.,
                RNN states) by processing each point jointly with the spatiotemporal neighbouring points. We tested the network performance with a MINST dataset of moving digits, a synthetic
                human bodies motions and JPEG dynamic bodies datasets.
                Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms
                baseline ones that neglect geometry features information}

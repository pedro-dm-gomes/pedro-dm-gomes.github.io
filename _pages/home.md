I am a final-year PhD student at UCL. 

Everything is a graph; my research goal is to use Graph Neural Networks to model it.



###  About me
I earned my BSc and MSc in Electrical Engineering at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) and Politecnico di Torino (Italy).

In February 2020, I joined the LASP group at UCL as a PhD student.
During my PhD, I worked on developing graph-based machine learning approaches to model irregular data, such as point clouds or radar data.


In the Summer of 2023, I interned at Nomura Bank  (Instinet), where I researched graph-based solutions for circuit design.

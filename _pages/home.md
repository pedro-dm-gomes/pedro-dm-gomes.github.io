I'm a final-year PhD student at UCL. I believe everything from social networks to 3D multimedia can be seen as a graph. My research is to devleopd tools to extract useful information from data representations.

###  About me
I earned my BSc in Electrical Engineering, and MSc in Computer Science at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) and Politecnico di Torino (Italy).

In February 2020, I joined the LASP group at UCL as a PhD student.
During my PhD, I worked on developing graph-based machine learning approaches to model irregular data, such as point clouds or radar data.


In the Summer of 2023, I interned at Nomura Bank  (Instinet), where I researched graph-based algorithms for circuit optimization.

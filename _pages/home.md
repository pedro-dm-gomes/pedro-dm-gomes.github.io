I'm a final-year PhD student at UCL. Almost all data structures in the real world, from social networks to 3D multimedia, can be seen as graphs. My research is focused on the development of tools to extract useful information from data representations.

###  About me
I was born in Portugal. I earned my BSc in Electrical Engineering and MSc in Computer Science at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) and Politecnico di Torino (Italy).

In February 2020, I joined the LASP group at UCL as a PhD student.
During my PhD, I worked on developing graph-based machine learning approaches to model irregular data, such as point clouds or radar data.


In the Summer of 2023, I interned at Nomura Bank  (Instinet), where I researched graph-based algorithms for circuit optimization.

 <h4>Point Cloud Motion Forecasting via Graphâ€‘based Machine Learning</h4>
We propoaw a Graph Neural Network, that given a point cloud sequence can make accurate prediction of future frames.

We propose a learning approach that can process irregular point cloud sequences using a graph structure. To this end, we design a Graph-RNN cell that can leverage learned features, describing the local topology, to form spatio-temporal graphs, from where temporal correlations can be extracted as motion features.
The features are then processed by a novel attention model to predict future movements. The attention mechanism allows the network to dynamically model the composition of local and global motions.

 <h4>'Opening the black-box GNNs Explanability'</h4>



I developed a technique for feature disentanglement to visualize what is learned at each layer of a graph neural network and understand the impact of each input dimension on the learned embeddings.

Using this technique, we explained hierarchical features in the context of dynamic point cloud processing. We have shown 
1) The interpretation of low- and high-level features as local and global motions; 
2) The importance of different network components in current state-of-the-art models to achieve better PC predictions.

 <h4>Millimeter wave Radar Processing via GNNs</h4>
We investigated point cloud (PC) processing for machines and autonomous systems, specifically denoising PCs generated by millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensors. These sensors produce PCs that  are much sparser and noisier than other PC data (e.g., LiDAR), yet they are  more robust in challenging conditions such as in the presence of fog, dust, smoke, or rain.  
We present \dataset,  to the best of our knowledge,  the first  dataset which collects mmWave PCs describing \emph{indoor}  scenarios. 
We highlight the peculiarity of mmWave PCs in indoor settings, and the compelling needs for an accurate denoising task.  We cast this task as a classification problem and we analyze different key methodologies existing in the literature based on i)~point-based processing, ii)~geometrical prior, iii)~attention-based networks and we test their effectiveness on \dataset. Empirical results  reveal  limitations of these approaches when denoising sparse PCs. An in-depth analysis of these results highlights 
i)~the limits of point-based approaches on capturing 3D geometries available in the scene
% i)~the inability for existing models to capture the 3D geometry of the scene\ldc{Maybe it's too strong. We can say that point-based are unable since other ones are a bit better. This to show that we don't bring only bad news :)}, 
ii)~the importance of key features such as velocity in  the dataset for the denoising task, 
iii)~the limitation of existing classification approaches in dat
